# GNU Debugger (GDB)

## Usage

### Debugging C

Compile programs with the `-g` option which adds debugging information. Never use compiler optimization in debug builds.

```sh
gcc -g program.c

gdb a.out
```

### Debugging Assembly

```sh
gcc -m32 -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables -o program program.c

gdb program
```

### Rebuilding via make

GDB can rebuild an executable without exiting by running the `make` command. Note that breakpoints might've changed and need to be updated.

```sh
make

run
```

### Attaching to a running process

```sh
ps -A | grep a.out

gdb attach <pid> a.out
```
